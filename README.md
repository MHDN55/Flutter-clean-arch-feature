# Flutter Clean Architecture Helper

### A VS Code extension to streamline creating feature folders and use cases in Flutter projects using Clean Architecture.

## Features

This extension provides two main functionalities:

1. **Create Feature Folders**: Automatically generates the folder structure for a new feature following Clean Architecture principles.
2. **Create Use Case**: Quickly create a use case within an existing feature.

## Commands

The following commands are available in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) under the `Arch` category:

### 1. Create Feature Folders

**Command:** `Create Feature Folders`

- **Description**: Generates the Clean Architecture folder structure for a new feature in your project.
- **Usage**:
  1. Open the Command Palette and run the `Create Feature Folders` command.
  2. Enter a feature name (e.g., `auth`, `home`), and the following folder structure will be generated:
    ```
    lib/
      features/
        feature_name/
          domain/
            entities/
            repo/
            usecases/
          data/
            datasources/
            models/
            repo/
          presentation/
            blocs/
            pages/
            widgets/
    ```

### 2. Create Use Case

**Command:** `Create Use Case`

- **Description**: Adds a use case class to a specified featureâ€™s `domain/usecases` folder.
- **Usage**:
  1. Open the Command Palette and run the `Create Use Case` command.
  2. Enter the feature name (must already exist).
  3. Enter the use case name (e.g., `FetchUserData`), and a file with the following template will be created:
    ```dart
    import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';
    import 'package:injectable/injectable.dart';

    @lazySingleton
    class FetchUserDataUseCase {
      final Repo _repo;

      FetchUserDataUseCase(this._repo);

      Future<Either<Failure, Entity>> call() async =>
          await _repo.doSomething();
    }
    ```
