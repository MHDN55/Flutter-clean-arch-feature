# Flutter Clean Architecture Helper

![Extension Icon](icon.png)

### A VS Code extension to streamline creating feature folders and use cases in Flutter projects using Clean Architecture.

---

## Features

This extension provides the following functionalities:

1. **Create Feature Folders**: Automatically generates the folder structure for a new feature following Clean Architecture principles.
    - After entering the feature name, you'll be asked whether to include **Injectable annotations** (`@LazySingleton`) in the generated files (since version 1.5.0).
2. **Create Use Case**: Quickly create a use case within an existing feature.

---

## Commands

The following commands are available in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) under the `Arch` category:

### 1. Create Feature Folders

**Command:** `Create Feature Folders`

- **Description**: Generates the Clean Architecture folder structure for a new feature in your project.

  2. Enter a feature name (e.g., `auth`, `home`).
  3. Choose whether you want **Injectable annotations** added (available from version 1.5.0).
  4. The following folder structure will be generated:
    ```
    lib/
      features/
        feature_name/
          domain/
            entities/

- **Usage**:
  1. Open the Command Palette and run the `Create Use Case` command.
  2. Enter the feature name (must already exist).
  3. Enter the use case name (e.g., `FetchUserData`), and a file with the following template will be created:
    ```dart
    import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';
    import 'package:injectable/injectable.dart';

    @lazySingleton
    class FetchUserDataUseCase {
      final Repo _repo;

      FetchUserDataUseCase(this._repo);

      Future<Either<Failure, Entity>> call() async =>
          await _repo.doSomething();
